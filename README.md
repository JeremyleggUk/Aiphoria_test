Interview test for Aiphoria

I spent around 1.5 hours on this. 

Given the time restraints i worked until the UI made some sense and was usable, however it could be majprly improved. Given more time i would smooth out the UI and separate the sections in a much nicer way. Additionally i would add UI validators on the inputs to ensure the user could only add numbers and have the generate button disable based on the validity. I would also add the functionalty to update the colour of the numbers based on their value, which i did not do.
